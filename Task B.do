//Introduction and data cleaning.
//We are insterested in the factors determining the weekly wage for the whole 
//Australian population, using the wage data of those who are currently working.
//First, we check the data by looking at the summary statistics. 
sum
///In this dataset, we have variables relating personal earnings, age, gender,
//current employment status, eduction level, number of dependent children,
//having concenssion card or not, self-reported health, and marital status.
//All variables are discrete or dummy variables except income related variables.

//There are a lot of missing values in logincome, which is caused by the zero
//in disposable income. There are also missing values in 'lfp' because many
//people did not respond to the employment status question in the survey. Same 
//with 'esempst' which is a more detailed employment status variable, 'scage'
//which indicating age group,  'male', 'edhigh' which is the highest education 
//level, 'concession' and 'married'.
//Since we want to study the weekly wage, we will use 'wscei' as our dependent 
//variable. So we check its histogram.
histogram wscei
//From this histogram we can see 'wscei' is not normally distributed, actually 
//its distribution looks like exponential distribution, where it may be better 
//to do log transformation to it and then analyse. 
gen logwscei=log(wscei)
histogram logwscei
//Hence, we generated a new variable named logwscei which is the log(wscei).
//And we can see its histogram looks much more like normal than wscei.
//But now we have much less observations since a lot of missing values are 
//generated by this log-transformation. This could be a problem for Tobit model.
//Therefore, we will follow the instruction in our exercise first and talk
//about this issue later on.
//Also we want to keep as many observations as we could, 
//so we will not use any employment status related variables in this dataset 
//directly. Instead, we will generate a new dummy variable called 'working' 
//indicating if a person is working or not given the value of his/her 'wscei'
//as our selection variable.
//We will also use 'male', detailed 'age' band variables (the youngest group is
//the reference level), and four 'education' levels (less than year 12 will be 
//the reference) as the determinants for the outcome equation. Because age and
//education are obviously have strong correlation with one's wage. To confirm,
//we do cross tabulation for age and wage.
tab scage, summarize(wscei)
//From this cross tabulation, we can see strong relationship between 'age' and 
//'wscei'. Wage is increasing with age before 45-54, and dreasing with it after.
//Unfortunately, gender is assumed to still have some impact as well.
//'Marital status' and 'dependent children' will be included in the selection 
//equation as extra IVs. Because these two factors will definitely have impact
//on one person's employment status but assumed to be irrelevant to one's wage.

gen working = wscei != 0
lab var working "=1 for working people, =0 otherwise"

//Check the new variable by looking at its summary statistics.
tab working
//In this subset, there are 8216 working people indicated by 'working', while 
//8216 non-working people. This 'working' variable maybe not necessarily accurate
//given the way we generated it. So we check the cross tabulation of it with 
//other employment status variables.
tab esbrd working
//We can see there are some mismatch between the two, since some 'employee' 
//indicated by 'esbrd' are grouped as 0 in 'working'. This may because some 
//employees did not report the weekly wage. As far as our assignment concerned,
//we will assume the working status are mostly correct specified and use it in 
//our further analysis.

//As we can see, the estimated coefficients are very different for these two
//methods in the outcome equation. I think the reason for that is what we 
//mentioned above, the normal assumption is clearly violated in this case, 
//so the estimated standard deviations are very large. Hence the estimates are
//very sensitive to the change in estimating methods.

//What's more, we can see the estimated rho is negative. Intuitively, it is more
//reasonable to be positive. The residuals in the outcome equation and the 
//selection equation maybe positively correlted. Because the unobserved factors
//that make people working are more likely to also make people earn more.
//I think this may due to the lack of good IVs. Or it could be x variables take
//too much information in residuals which over-compensated the issue. Or maybe
//our dataset is not a good one.

//Continued from our previous discussion about the negative rho, we can see 
//some weird results from these two marginal effects. For instance, the marginal 
//effect of achieving bachelor degree is larger on the working group which is 
//582.4258 while 558.4575 on the whole population. In reality, we think
//education should have bigger marginal effect on the whole population than 
//the working people since employees are often have higher education level than
//unemployees. This result is caused by the fact that our estimated rho is
//negative.
